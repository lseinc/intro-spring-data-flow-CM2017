#### Introduction to Spring Data Flow (CodeMash 2017)

This is a quick introduction overview of Spring Data Flow with some simple scripts to run a local server instance.  
Scripts are also included for modifying minikube to setup a kubernetes server instance.  
Slides are under the slides directory.  
Examples are simple hello world type things to show that the environment is up and running.  

I will push the slides up first and clean up the scripts and files and push that at a later date.

Thanks for attending the presentation and I hope you investigate Spring Data Flow Server further!

Enjoy!
